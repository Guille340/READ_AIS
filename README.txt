Read AIS
=========

MATLAB code for reading AIS data of a .csv table exported from PAMGuard's
database. The code cannot read from .aistext (SeicheSSV) or directly from
PAMGuard's database.

A MATLAB package developed by Robin Bye for reading navigation data from AIS 
strings is also included in "AIS Toolbox" folder.
